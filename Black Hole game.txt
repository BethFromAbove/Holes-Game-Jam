Black Hole game

1. We are the black hole

eating everything
getting bigger/grav pull or scoring points
How do you die?
How do you win?


2. Avoid the black holes
You are the rocket ship
Collect astronaughts floating in space
Avoid planets
Could be being chased by sentient black hole?
Or black holes are randomly around the path, muts be avoided
Game gets faster every 100 points, harder to avoid to avoid black holes

Assets:
Rocket
Particle effects on bottom of the rocket
black hole sprite
Astronaughts
Planets x 4
Background
Logo? (Astronaught falling into black hole?)


Coding:
Camera following only up
tile map? Infinite/looping background?
Add particle effects to rocket and have them follow
add loading screen and options menu
make github repo
Add game end screen
Add points counter persists
make it go faster at higher points


stretch goal: add extra gravity to black holes (see 'we are black hole')
Highscore leader board
Choose rocket colour
make points look clock font

Name the ship
Pick a colour

Could make both quite easily!

Use actual picture of black hole!
Make our own sprite of the black hole!
black could expand or change colour slightly

or classic cartoon black hole?


TODO:
Make it go faster at higher points- playtesting
Start slower, have astros be slightly faster than planets
more blackholes - as you go through game
Track individual high scores

Add highscore to game page
add pulsing text end screen which says New High Score!!!
Randomise black hole start


Stretch goal
Add ship naming screen
add gravity to black holes (make some more pngs for black holes to grow)
Add sound effects?

Done:
Name it!
Pick Background music
Space out planets randomly - fewer planets to start out with
Particle effects for rocket - make red and nice
choose colour
better game endscreen - add logo


Name ideas:
