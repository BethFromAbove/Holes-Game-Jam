How do you die?
How do you win?


2. Avoid the black holes

Could be being chased by sentient black hole?
Or black holes are randomly around the path, muts be avoided
Game gets faster every 100 points, harder to avoid to avoid black holes

Coding:
Camera following only up
tile map? Infinite/looping background?
Add particle effects to rocket and have them follow
add loading screen and options menu

Add game end screen
Add points counter persists
make it go faster at higher points


stretch goal: add extra gravity to black holes (see 'we are black hole')
Highscore leader board

Could make both quite easily!

Use actual picture of black hole!
Make our own sprite of the black hole!
